/**
 * This package provides implementations of the SnowFlake algorithm for efficient generation of unique identifiers in distributed systems.
 * <p>
 * ### Key Features
 * - **Guaranteed Uniqueness**: Ensures globally unique IDs when configured properly in distributed environments.
 * - **Time-Sorted IDs**: IDs are ordered based on their generation time, making chronological sorting possible.
 * - **High Performance**: Supports the generation of multiple IDs within the same millisecond.
 * - **Distributed Use**: Operates independently without requiring central coordination.
 * <p>
 * ### Components
 * - **AtomicSnowFlake**: A thread-safe implementation of the SnowFlake ID generator.
 * - **SnowFlake**: A non-thread-safe but versatile implementation of the SnowFlake ID generator.
 * - **ISnowFlake**: A common interface defining the structure of SnowFlake ID generators.
 * <p>
 * ### Considerations
 * - **Clock Synchronization**: Proper clock synchronization is essential across multiple nodes for correct ordering.
 * - **Unique Machine IDs**: Ensure the machine ID is unique across nodes to avoid ID collisions.
 * - **Epoch Configuration**: Selecting a custom epoch that aligns well with application requirements is critical.
 * <p>
 * This package is particularly useful for systems where efficient and distributed ID generation is vital for performance and scalability.
